# 🚀 Bitcoin Wallet Generator (BIP39 + BIP84 Bech32)

This project is a web application that allows generating Bitcoin wallets compatible with **BIP39** and **BIP84**, thus creating **Bech32** addresses (`bc1...`), which are more secure and modern.

## 📌 Features

Use this program **only locally**.

✅ Generate a **BIP39 mnemonic phrase** (with an optional passphrase)\
✅ Convert the phrase into a **WIF private key** and Bitcoin Bech32 address (`bc1...`)
<br>
✅ Display and **protect the private key** (clickable to show/hide)\
✅ **Generate QR codes** for the mnemonic phrase, address, and private key\
✅ **Modern and responsive web interface**

## 🖥 Automatic Installation

### 🔹 Linux/macOS

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

### 🔹 Windows

```bat
install.bat
```

## 🔧 Manual Installation and Usage

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have installed:

- **Python 3.10+** ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **pip** (usually included with Python)
- **Git** (optional, but recommended for cloning the project)

### 2️⃣ Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin_wallet_generator.git
cd bitcoin_wallet_generator
```

(If you don’t have Git, download the project as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it)

### 3️⃣ Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

If port 5000 is already in use:

```bash
python app.py --port 5001
```

Then open **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)** in your browser.

## 🔄 Import Your Wallet into Electrum

If you want to use your wallet in Electrum:

1️⃣ **Open Electrum** and create a **new wallet** <br>
2️⃣ Choose **"Standard Wallet"** then **"I already have a seed"** <br>
3️⃣ Enter the mnemonic phrase generated by the application <br>
4️⃣ Make sure **BIP39 is detected** and check "BIP39 seed" <br>
5️⃣ Select **"Native SegWit (bech32)"** to generate `bc1...` addresses

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### ❌ **Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"**

👉 Make sure you have installed the dependencies correctly:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### ❌ **Issue: "Address already in use"**

👉 Another process is already using port 5000. Try:

```bash
python app.py --port 5001
```

### ❌ **WIF Private Key Rejected by Electrum**

👉 Electrum works with **HD wallets (BIP39/BIP84)**. Importing only a WIF private key will create a wallet limited to a single address.

🔹 **Solution**: Import the **mnemonic phrase** instead of the private key.
